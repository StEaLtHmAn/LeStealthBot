# - How does it work:
You setup a list of game presets and every 5 seconds (modifiable) it checks which game is running in the foreground, if the foreground game is on the presets list, then it updates your channels title and category based on the preset.

# - Installation/setup:
To install you have to unzip the files from the releases section (or build the code yourself) and run the .exe file. The first time you run the application you will have to login.
